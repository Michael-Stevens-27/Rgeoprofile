\title{Calculate and plot probability of coallocation}
\usage{
geoPlotCoallocation(mcmc, cols = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mcmc}{object of the type output by geoMCMC().}

\item{cols}{colour palette to use. Defaults to viridis palette.}
}
\description{
For all pairs of crimes, calculates the probability that both originate from the same source and plots a coloured half matrix representing these data. The data underlying these calculations can be accessed as the object $coAllocation produced by geoMCMC().
}
\examples{
\donttest{
# London example data
d <- LondonExample_crimes
s <- LondonExample_sources
p <- geoParams(data = d, sigma_mean = 1.0, sigma_squared_shape = 2)
#m <- geoMCMC(data = d, params = p)
# produce simple map
#geoPlotMap(params = p, data = d, source = s, surface = m$geoProfile,
#                breakPercent = seq(0, 50, 5), mapType = "hybrid",
#                crimeCol = "black", crimeCex = 2, sourceCol = "red", sourceCex = 2)
# calculate coallocation matrix and plot
#geoPlotCoallocation(m)
