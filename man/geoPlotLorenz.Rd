\title{Produce Lorenz Plot}
\usage{
geoPlotLorenz(
  hit_scores,
  crimeNumbers = NULL,
  suspects_col = "red",
  crimes_col = "blue"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{hit_scores}{object in the format defined by geoReportHitscores().}

\item{crimeNumbers}{optional vector with numbers of crimes per suspect site.}

\item{suspects_col}{colour to plot curve for sources.}

\item{crimes_col}{colour to plot curve for crimes if crimeNumbers is supplied.}
}
\description{
Produces a Lorenz plot showing the proportion of suspect sites or crimes identified as a function of area and calculates
the corresponding Gini coefficient using trapezoid rule.
Also allows an optional vector called crimeNumbers with numbers of crimes per suspect site; the length of this vector
should equal the number of suspect sites. If this is present, the function calculates and returns the Gini coefficient 
based on the number of crimes; otherwise, this is calculated based on the number of suspect sites.
