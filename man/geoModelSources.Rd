\title{Extract latitude and longitude of points identified as sources by geoMCMC()}
\usage{
geoModelSources(mcmc, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{mcmc}{Model output in the format produced by geoMCMC().}

\item{data}{Crime site data, in the format produced by geoData().}
}
\description{
This function takes the output of geoMCMC() and, for each 'crime', extracts the group to which it is assigned with the highest probability. For each group, the model returns the mean lat/long of all crimes assigned to that group.
}

# simulated data
sim <-rDPM(50, priorMean_longitude = -0.04217491, priorMean_latitude = 
51.5235505, alpha=10, sigma=1, tau=3)
d <- geoData(sim$longitude, sim $latitude)
s <- geoDataSource(sim$source_lon, sim$source_lat)
p <- geoParams(data = d, sigma_mean = 1.0, sigma_squared_shape = 2)
#m <- geoMCMC(data = d, params = p)
## extract sources identified by the model
#ms <- geoModelSources(mcmc = m, data = d)
# plot data showing the sources identified by the model (note: NOT the actual suspect sites)
