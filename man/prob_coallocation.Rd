\title{Calculate and plot probability of coallocation}
\usage{
prob_coallocation(crime1, crime2, coallocation_matrix, offset = 0.005,
  plot.graph = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{crime1}{numerical index of first crime}

\item{crime2}{numerical index of second crime}

\item{coallocation_matrix}{matrix of coallocations between all observations, as produced the "allocation" output of the function geoMCMC()}

\item{offset}{vertical offset of second line to ensure readability}

\item{plot.graph}{whether to plot the graph}
}
\description{
Calculates the probability that two crimes are from the same source.
Also allows an optional plot showing the probabilities of allocation different
sources for each of the two selected crimes, using myMCMC$allocation.
The function returns the position of the two chosen crimes in the original
list, their lon/lat and the probability that they come from the same source.
