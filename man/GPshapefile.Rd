\title{Incorporate shapefile or raster information into a geoprofile}
\usage{
GPshapefile(probSurface, params, shapefile,
  masterProj = "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84", scaleValue = 1,
  operation = "inside", maths = "multiply")
}
\arguments{
\item{probSurface}{the original geoprofile, usually the object $posteriorSurface produced by geoMCMC().}

\item{params}{an object produced by geoParams().}

\item{shapefile}{the spatial information to include. Must be either SpatialPolygonsDataFrame or RasterLayer.}

\item{masterProj}{the projection to use, eg "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84".}

\item{scaleValue}{different functions depending on value of "operation". For "inside' or "outside", the value by which probabilities should be multiplied inside or outside the shapefile; set to zero to exclude completely. For "near" and "far", the importance of proximity to, or distance from, the object described in the RasterLayer or SpatialPointsDataFrame. Not used for "continuous".}

\item{operation}{thow to combine the surface and the new spatial information. Must be one of "inside", "outside", "near", "far" or "continuous". The first two multiply areas inside or outside the area described in the shapefile (or raster) by scaleValue. "near" or "far" weight the geoprofile by its closeness to (or distance from) the area described in the shapefile (or raster). Finally, "continuous" uses a set of numerical values (eg altitude) to weight the geoprofile.}

\item{maths}{one of "add", "subtract", multiply" or "divide. The mathematical operation used to combine the new spatial data with the geoprofile when operation = "continuous".}
}
\description{
This function allows information from a shapefile or raster to be incorporated within the geoprofile. For example, we might wish to exclude areas not on land, or weight the probabilities within a specific postcode differently. The spatial object used should be a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame as produced by the package sp or a raster.
