### Introduction

Now that we have installed R and Rstudio, it's time to get down to some coding! This tutorial will focus on the fundamental basics of writing and running R code. This will include:

  * The Rstudio interface
  * Where to write and run code
  * Basic arithmetic
  * Assigning objects
  
### The Rstudio interface

As mentioned in the previous tutorial when you start up Rstudio, you should be welcomed with the following interface: 

\

\  

The intereface should consist of four main panels: 

**1** - The **top left** panel is the script window; this is where you will write all of your code. This window may not be currently visible, if not, click on File -> New File -> Rscript. Or, simply type `Ctrl Shift N` on the keyboard.
  
**2** - Once you have written your code, you will need to run it. The **bottom left** panel consists of the following tabs:

* *Console* - This is the window where you will be running your code and reading off the output. A line of code can be sent from the script to the console by clicking on the relevant line of code and hitting `Ctrl ENTER` on the keyboard. 
* *Terminal* - This allows you to access the command prompt from Rstudio without having to pull another window up.
* *Jobs* - This tab allows us to run some code in the background whilst allowing us to continue using Rstudio.
  
**3** - The **top right** panel displays a few different pieces of information:

* *Environment* - This will list the different R objects in the current R session. We can see an example here, that `x` is equal to `5`.
* *History* - This gives us a list of each piece of code we have sent to the terminal window
* *Connections* - Allows us to connect to data bases, making data importing and manipoulation an easier process. 
* *Tutorial* - Displays tutorials built via the `learnr` package.
  
**4** - The **bottom right** panel is also responsible for many things as we can see across the tabs:

* *Files* - This shows the current directory that we are in. This will be useful later for accessing data. 
* *Plots* - If we've written some code to plot a graph, this will show up in the window once we've run the relevant code. 
* *Packages* - This will list off all the packages that are being used in the current R session. 
* *Help* - This window will pop open anytime you run some code seeking help with a particular function. For example, running `?sd` will display the documentation on the `sd` function.  
* *Viewer* - This will display a preview of any HTML documents or shiny apps that you are building.

This was a lot of information in one go! Don't worry too much about remembering it all. This page is here for you to come back to if and when you need it. There will be a reminder throughout these tutorials when we revisit any of the above.

### Running, writing and commenting code

Let's start with a simple example - can we get R to add 1 and 2 together? There are two ways we can do this. Firstly, we can click inside the console window (number 2 above), type `1 + 2` and hit `ENTER`.

\  

We should see the number `3` get spat out by the console as shown above. The other, and preferable, way to run this code is to type it up in the script window (number 1 above) and hit `Ctrl ENTER` to send the code down to the console. 

\

\  

As we can see, this results in the same output. Writing in an Rscript is preferable over typing code straight into the console because the console requires us to type out the same code over and over again. Writing in an Rscript means we write the code out once and only requires `Ctrl ENTER` to rerun. It's pretty obvious that running `1 + 2` will calculate the sum of one and two. However, it won't always be obvious what our code is doing and for this reason it is incredibly important to **comment our code**. Commenting consists of writing notes in the Rscript that describe what our code is doing and why. We can comment out a line of code using the "number" or "hashtag" symbol `#`. Revisiting our example of adding one and two: 

\  
![](https://github.com/Michael-Stevens-27/Rgeoprofile/raw/workshop/docs/articles/images/comment.png)
\  

Any line of code starting with the `#` symbol will be ignored by R when running the code. As we can see, R ignored the line with the comment and then ran `1 + 2` normally. Commenting code is fundemental to good coding practice. This way, when you revisit any code, you know exactly what it is doing. It is becoming common practice to provide code to publishers as supplementary material when submitting a publication, hence we want to make sure our code is as transparent as possible when sharing it with others. 

### Assigning an object 

assigning symbols "=" reads left to right, "<-" reads in the direction of the arrow

### R operators

Arithmetic operators:

```{r}
# addition "+"
7 + 8

# subtraction "-"
19 - 22

# multiplication "*"
3 * 7

# division "/"
52 / 9

# exponentiation "^" or "**"
3 ^ 2
# or
3 ** 2

# modulus "%%" - giving the remainder after division
7 %% 3

# integer division "%/%"
7 %/% 3

```

Logical operators:

```{r}
# less than "<"
5 < 7
7 < 5

# less than or equal to "<="
19 <= 22
22 <= 22

# greater than ">"
7 > 3
3 > 7

# greater than or equal to ">="
52 >= 9
52 >= 52

# exactly equal to "=="
3 == 3
3 == 3.1

# not equal to "!="
3 != 2
3 != 3

# not x "!x"
5 > 4      
!(5 > 4)

# x or y "x | y"
7 > 3 | 7 > 8

# x and y "x & y"
7 > 3 & 7 > 8
7 > 3 & 7 > 6
```

### More examples

Putting everything together here's a few examples combining the above with some explanation too.
