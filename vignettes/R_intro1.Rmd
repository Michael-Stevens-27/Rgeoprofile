# Introduction

Now that we have installed R and Rstudio, it's time to get down to some coding! This tutorial will focus on the fundamental basics of writing and running R code. This will include:

  * The Rstudio interface
  * Where to write and run code
  * Basic arithmetic
  * Assigning objects
  
# The Rstudio interface

As mentioned in the previous tutorial when you start up Rstudio, you should be welcomed with the following interface:

\  

The intereface should consist of four main panels: 

**1** - The **top left** panel is the script window; this is where you will write all of your code. This window may not be currently visible, if not, click on File -> New File -> Rscript. Or, simply type `Ctrl Shift N` on the keyboard.
  
**2** - Once you have written your code, you will need to run it. The **bottom left** panel consists of the following tabs:

* *Console* - This is the window where you will be running your code and reading off the output. A line of code can be sent from the script to the console by clicking on the relevant line of code and hitting `Ctrl ENTER` on the keyboard. 
* *Terminal* - This allows you to access the command prompt from Rstudio without having to pull another window up.
* *Jobs* - This tab allows us to run some code in the background whilst allowing us to continue using Rstudio.
  
**3** - The **top right** panel displays a few different pieces of information:

* *Environment* - This will list the different R objects in the current R session. We can see an example here, that `x` is equal to `5`.
* *History* - This gives us a list of each piece of code we have sent to the terminal window
* *Connections* - Allows us to connect to data bases, making data importing and manipoulation an easier process. 
* *Tutorial* - Displays tutorials built via the `learnr` package.
  
**4** - The **bottom right** panel is also responsible for many things as we can see across the tabs:

* *Files* - This shows the current directory that we are in. This will be useful later for accessing data. 
* *Plots* - If we've written some code to plot a graph, this will show up in the window once we've run the relevant code. 
* *Packages* - This will list off all the packages that are being used in the current R session. 
* *Help* - This window will pop open anytime you run some code seeking help with a particular function. For example, running `?sd` will display the documentation on the `sd` function.  
* *Viewer* - This will display a preview of any HTML documents or shiny apps that you are building.
