This really is the very first step to getting to grips with R. Before we can do anything, we will need to install it on your computer.  

# Installing R 

We are going to install R from the [R project website](https://www.r-project.org/). This is the main website for finding different versions of R, hearing news, reporting bugs and help with using R in general.

We will be installing version XX for this workshop. Click on the "download R" button. Which will lead you to the following page:

Go ahead and click on the "South Africa" option, leading us to:

Since this will be the first time installing R, click on the "base" option.

Finally, click on the "Download R 4.0.3 for Windows" option. Once this has finished downloading run the .exe file and follow the installation process as prompted on your computer screen.

# Installing Rstudio

Now that we have installed R, we now need to install the user interface for R, R studio. This can be installed from the [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/) website. Click on "download" button on the top right hand corner of the screen.
