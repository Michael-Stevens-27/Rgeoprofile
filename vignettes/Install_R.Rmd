This really is the very first step to getting to grips with R. Before we can do anything, we will need to install it on your computer.  

# Installing R 

We are going to install R from the [R project website](https://www.r-project.org/). This is the main website for finding different versions of R, reporting bugs and help with using R in general. Clicking on the link above will lead us to the main website where we will find a link for downloading R, immediately below "getting started".

Next we need to choose the location we will be installing from. For this workshop, the best location will be "South Africa". There are many options here, but choosing the closest location ensures the installation is as quick as possible.

Go ahead and click on the "South Africa" option, leading us to:

\  

Click on the "Download R for windows" option.

\  

Since this will be the first time installing R, click on the "base" option.

\  

Finally, click on the "Download R 4.0.3 for Windows" option. Once this has finished downloading run the .exe file and follow the installation process as prompted on your computer screen.

\  

Move through each of the steps, leaving all of the pre-selected settings as they are, and click "next" until you reach the install window.

Once this is done, click "finish".

# Installing Rstudio

Now that we have installed R, we need to install the user interface for R, R studio. This can be installed from the [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/) website. Click on the "download" button on the top right hand corner of the screen.

\  

Next, we want the free version of Rstudio:

\  

And we want to download the .exe file for windows. We will then follow the same process as for the previous installation. Click on the .exe file once it's finished downloading and then follow the setup process prompted on screen.

\  

That's it! We have downloaded R and Rstudio. To open a new instance of Rstudio, click on the windows button at the bottom left of the screen, search for Rstudio and click on the Rstudio app in the results. That's all the installing we need to do for R and Rstudio. In the next tutorial we will have a look at the Rstudio interface in detail and start writing some R code.
