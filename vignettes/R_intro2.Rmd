## Introduction 

In this tutorial we will move on to the next steps of using R, this will include:

* Using functions
* Classes, vectors, matrices
* More functions
* Reading in data
* Plotting
* Getting help
* Packages
* Loops

## Using functions

In R, **functions** are tools that we use that take some input and produce an output. The standard format for a function is the following:

```{r}
my_function <- function( arguments ) { body }
```    

The term `function` here refers to the fact we are writing a function. This function has `arguments`. We refer to `arguments` as the input for the function. The `body` of the function contains all the code that manipulates the input arguments to produce the output. Finally, we assign this function to an object so we can use it later. Notice that the arguments ar contained within parantheses `()`, bu the body of the function is contained within curly brackets `{}`. Let's see an example. In the previous tutorial we wrote some code that added one and two together. Let's write a function that adds any two numbers together.  

```{r}
# write a function that adds two numbers together and returns the sum
add <- function(x, y){
  z <- x + y 
  return(z)
}
```    

Let's go through this line by line. In the first line we assign our function to the object name `add`, we then open up `function` with a left parenthesis, type out our arguments (two numbers, `x` and `y`) then close the parentheses. We then open up the body of the function by opening the curly brackets. we then begin the body on the next line. The next two lines assign the sum of `x` and `y` to a new object `z` and then we return `z` using the `return()` function. We then close the curly brackets. Let's try using our function:

```{r}
# add one and two, again
add(1, 2)
```    

Notice that the R environment now has a function in its memory.

## Classes

In the previous tutorial we played around with some basic arithmetic and logical statements such as the below:

```{r}
# assign x the value 7
x <- 7

# assign y the outcome of the logical statement x > 4
y <- x > 4
y
``` 

In these examples the **class** of `x` is reffered to as **numeric** and the class of `y` is reffered to as **logical**. This is of course, since `x` represents the numerical value `5` and `y`, the logical value `TRUE`. There is another important class we are yet to use, that is, the **character** class. The class of an object is character if it has been assigned using double or single quotation marks (`" "` or `' '`).

```{r}
# create a character object
my_name <- "john smith"
my_address <- '123 Fake Street'
```

We can view an object's class using the `class()` function. For this function, we input an object and the output will print the object's class. 

```{r}
# create a numerical, logical and character objects
x <- 27
class(x)

y <- 15 != 12
class(y)

z <- "hello"
class(z)
```

## Vectors and Matrices

Vectors and matrices are a couple of the main data types in R.  Using vectors and matrices we can collect and manipulate multiple R objects at the same time. To create a vector we use an important R function denoted by `c()`. Here, `c()` can be thought of as short for "concatonate" or "collect". Using `c()` we can collect objects of the same type together to create a vector.

```{r}
# create a vector
my_vector <- c(7, 2, 5, 1, 6, 19)
my_vector
```

Notice that `my_vector` has appeared in the top right in R studio. 

\

\  

We can see that now gives us more information than simply the values in this vector. In addition to this, R stores the class of the vector "num" short for "numerical" and the **index** of the vector runs from one to six, denoted by "[1:6]". If we want to access a particular value or set of values from our vector, then we need to provide R with the index of the values we want. We do this using square brakets `[]`.

```{r}
# access the 3rd value in our vector
my_vector[3]

# access the 2nd and 5th value in our vector
my_vector[c(2,5)]
```

A **matrix** is a collection of values that spans many rows and columns. We can constuct a matrix using the `matrix()` function. In order to build a matrix, the function requires a vector of values, the numbe of rows and the number of columns. Let's use `my_vector` to populate a matrix with 3 rows and 2 columns. 

```{r}
# create a matrix using my_vector
my_matrix <- matrix(data = my_vector, nrow = 3, ncol = 2)

my_matrix
```

## More on functions

Arguments, where to put them, leaving them blank and defaults. 

Function on vectors: sum, sd, mean, seq, max, min, range  

## More examples

arithmetic and logical operators on vectors, indices for both vectors and matrices. Indexing with logical statements.
