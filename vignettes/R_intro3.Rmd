## Introduction 

In this final R tutorial we will work through the last subjects to get you up to speed before moving on to geographic profiling in R. This tutorial will focus on the following: 

* Installing and using R packages
* Directories and reading data
* Data frames
* Plotting
* Getting help

## Packages

In the previous tutorial we touched on a few of R's built in functions. We even saw an example of writing our own `add` function. You may find yourself in a position where you need a function that R's built-in library cannot provide you with and that may be too complex to write yourself. There are a number of **R packages** that can be downloaded that provide you with extra functions for many different uses. We will see in the next tutorial how to download `RgeoProfile`, a package for spatial analysis. Navigate to the "Packages" tab of the bottom right pane in Rstudio. 

\      
![](https://github.com/Michael-Stevens-27/Rgeoprofile/raw/workshop/docs/articles/images/packages.png)
\  

<!-- ```{r, echo = F, out.width="400px"}
download.file(url = "https://github.com/Michael-Stevens-27/Rgeoprofile/raw/workshop/docs/articles/images/packages.png",
          destfile = "image1.png",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "image1.png")
``` -->

Here we can see all of the packages that have already been downloaded. In order to install a package that is not in our system, we use the `install.packages()` function in the following way:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install raster package
install.packages("raster")
```

Using this we will install the `raster` package. This package is full of tools for spatial analysis and we will need in future tutorials. The `install.packages()` function will download the chosen package from **CRAN**, the online repository for R packages. The full list of R packages can be found [via this link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_date.html). To load a package we use the `library()` function. For example, to load the "raster" package, we would run the following in the script window:

```{r}
# load raster package
library(raster)
```

The raster package also loads another package for spatial analysis; the "sp" package. Notice the empty boxes down the left hand side of the "Packages" tab. Clicking on these boxes is another method for loading packages. 

\      
![](https://github.com/Michael-Stevens-27/Rgeoprofile/raw/workshop/docs/articles/images/load_packages.png)
\  

<!-- ```{r, echo = F, out.width="400px"}
download.file(url = "https://github.com/Michael-Stevens-27/Rgeoprofile/raw/workshop/docs/articles/images/load_packages.png",
          destfile = "image1.png",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "image1.png")
``` -->

## Directories and reading data

In addition to many built-in functions, R also comes with a variety of different data sets for a user to play around with when developing their R skills. To see the full list of datasets provided by R and other packages, run the `data()` function with blank parentheses.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# show list of built-in data sets
data()
```

\      
![](https://github.com/Michael-Stevens-27/Rgeoprofile/raw/workshop/docs/articles/images/data.png)
\  

<!-- ```{r, echo = F, out.width="400px"}
download.file(url = "https://github.com/Michael-Stevens-27/Rgeoprofile/raw/workshop/docs/articles/images/data.png",
          destfile = "image2.png",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "image2.png")
``` -->

Here we can see a few examples, including the "mtcars" data set, this describes the output of road tests carried out on a series of popular motor vehicles. To load the "mtcars" data set, we simply return to the `data()` function:

```{r}
# load mtcars data set
data(mtcars)

# view to first handful of rows of this data set using the head() function 
head(mtcars)
```

In addition to built-in data sets, a user will need to import their own data into R too. Rstudio makes this a little easier by allowing the user to choose the type of file when importing their data and where R can find said file. We can import a data file by going to File -> Import Dataset -> From ... and choosing from the options depending on your file type. 

\      
![](https://github.com/Michael-Stevens-27/Rgeoprofile/raw/workshop/docs/articles/images/import_data.png)
\  
<!-- ```{r, echo = F, out.width="400px"}
download.file(url = "https://github.com/Michael-Stevens-27/Rgeoprofile/raw/workshop/docs/articles/images/import_data.png",
          destfile = "image3.png",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "image3.png")
``` -->

Rstudio will then open up a screen for you to navigate to the file. I've got an example file "my_data.txt" setup on my desktop here.

\      
![](https://github.com/Michael-Stevens-27/Rgeoprofile/raw/workshop/docs/articles/images/data_navigate.png)
\ 
<!-- ```{r, echo = F, out.width="400px"}
download.file(url = "https://github.com/Michael-Stevens-27/Rgeoprofile/raw/workshop/docs/articles/images/data_navigate.png",
          destfile = "image4.png",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "image4.png")
``` -->

It is common practice in R to make sure you are working within the directory that contains all the files associated with your work or project. We will know we are working in the correct directory when we can see our script and data file in the "files" tab of the bottom right window in Rstudio. We can choose our working directory by going to Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory.  

\      
![](https://github.com/Michael-Stevens-27/Rgeoprofile/raw/workshop/docs/articles/images/directories.png)
\  
<!-- ```{r, echo = F, out.width="400px"}
download.file(url = "https://github.com/Michael-Stevens-27/Rgeoprofile/raw/workshop/docs/articles/images/directories.png",
          destfile = "image5.png",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "image5.png")
``` -->

R will then prompt you to pick which location you wish to use as your working directory. Here I have chosen the location where I stored my data and script.    

\      
![](https://github.com/Michael-Stevens-27/Rgeoprofile/raw/workshop/docs/articles/images/desk_directory.png)
\  
<!-- ```{r, echo = F, out.width="400px"}
download.file(url = "https://github.com/Michael-Stevens-27/Rgeoprofile/raw/workshop/docs/articles/images/desk_directory.png",
          destfile = "image5.png",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "image5.png")
``` -->

Notice in the console window R ran the `setwd()` function for you automatically to change the directory. The "set working directory" function `setwd()` can be used manually, but it is much easier to navigate to your working directory using the process above. 

\      
![](https://github.com/Michael-Stevens-27/Rgeoprofile/raw/workshop/docs/articles/images/shift_directories.png)
\  
<!-- ```{r, echo = F, out.width="400px"}
download.file(url = "https://github.com/Michael-Stevens-27/Rgeoprofile/raw/workshop/docs/articles/images/shift_directories.png",
          destfile = "image6.png",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "image6.png")
``` -->

It is possible to check anytime which working directory is being currently used by using the `getwd()` function as follows:

```{r, eval = F}
# get the working directory
getwd()
```

## Data frames

In the previous tutorial we looked at a few different data types in R such as vectors and matrices. We established that these vectors or matrices were made up of either numeric, logical or character values. Another common data type is the **data frame**. A data frame is of a similar structure to a matrix, except that each column of that matrix may be of a different class (numerical, logical or character). We've already seen an example of this in the "mtcars" data set. However, all the values in this data frame were numerical. Let's see an example of a data frame with different classes in them. 

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# load the iris data frame
data(iris)

# see the first few rows of the data frame
head(iris)
``` 

Here we have loaded the `iris` data frame. This consists of the sepal and petal length and width of three different species of iris flower. Using the `head()` function tells R to display the first few rows of our data frame in the console window. As we can see all the lengths and widths are numeric values whereas the species names are character values (i.e. letters/words). When reading in data, R will automatically decide which of the three categories each column of your data falls under. To check this we can use the `str()` function.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# summarise each variable of the iris data 
str(iris)
``` 

So we can see, the data frame has 150 observations over 5 different variables. Notice that the final variable "Species" is referred to as a "Factor". This is R's way of organising the character variables into categories. `Factor w/ 3 levels` refers to the fact that the species variable has character values with 3 different categories. The `"setosa", "versicolor", ...: 1 1 1 1 ...` firstly shows R listing off each of these categories, these being the species names and then the numbers (`1 1 1 1 1 1 ...`) indicate which species each observation is associated with. So we know that the first few flowers are from the first category, in other words, the first species, which is "setosa". 

Say we wanted to find out which flower species has the largest sepal width. The first place your mind might go is to use the `max()` or `which.max()` functions on the data frame. However we don't want to look for the maximum value of all the variables, only sepal width. So how do we access this variable from the data frame? If you look closely at the output of the `str()` function, you'll see R is giving us a hint. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
str(iris)
```     

Next to each of the variables is a `$` sign. To access a variable from a data frame we write the name of the data frame followed by the `$` symbol followed by the variable name we want. 

```{r}
# access sepal length from the iris data frame using the $ symbol
sepal_width_only <- iris$Sepal.Width

print(sepal_width_only)
```     

We now have the values we want. Let's find out which one is the maximum. 

```{r}
# which sepal length is largest
max_sepal_width_index <- which.max(sepal_width_only)

# find all the rest of the data for this observation
iris[max_sepal_width_index, ]
```     

So the 16th flower has the largest sepal width and this flower is a member of the "setosa" species. 

## Plotting 

We've read in our data and now we would like to visualise it. R comes with many different built-in functions to plot and visualise our data. The most common function we use to do this is the `plot()` function. In its simplest form, the `plot()` function will produce a graph based on the object that is provided by a user:

```{r}
# create an object with some values
some_values <- c(1,4,2,3,6,5,8,2,9,10,2,4,5)
plot(some_values)
``` 

As we can see, R has plotted our values on the y-axis, with the corresponding index on the x-axis. We only plotted a single object though, let's specify the `x` and `y` values ourselves:

```{r}
# create two objects that will to plot on the x and y axis
some_x_values <- c(1, 4, 2, 3, 6, 5, 8, 2, 9, 10, 2, 4, 5)
some_y_values <- c(9, 7, 8, 6, 7, 8, 6, 7, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6)

# plot 
plot(x = some_x_values, y = some_y_values)
``` 

R has automatically generated this plot window along with all of its characteristics such as: the limits of the x and y axis, the size of the points, the symbol for the points, the x and y labels and many more. All of the above and more can be customised. See the `plot()` function documentation for the extensive list but here are a few examples: 

```{r}
# plot 
plot(x = some_x_values,        # plot x values
     y = some_y_values,        # plot y values 
     xlim = c(0, 11),          # set x limits
     ylim = c(3, 10),          # set y limits
     pch = 4,                  # set point symbol
     cex = 1,                  # set the size of points
     col = "red",              # set the colour of the points 
     xlab = "x values",        # set the x axis label
     ylab = "y values",        # set the y axis label
     main = "My plot title")   # set the plot title
``` 

If we go back to our Iris data, let's plot sepal length against sepal width for each of the flowers.  


```{r}
# plot 
plot(x = iris$Petal.Width,         # plot width of petals on the x axis
     y = iris$Petal.Length,        # plot length of petals on the y axis
     col = iris$Species,           # set the colour of the points based on species 
     pch = 20,                     # set point symbol
     cex = 1,                      # set the size of points
     xlab = "Petal Width",         # set the x axis label
     ylab = "Petal Length",        # set the y axis label
     main = "Petal measurements")  # set the plot title
``` 

Notice how we also coloured the points based on a categorical variable! In these plots, we have plotted continuous data against continuous data, hence R has responded accordingly and created a scatterplot when we called the `plot()` function. What if we switch the kind of data we are using? Let's say we want to plot the petal length for each species. We want to plot a continuous variable (petal length) against a categorical variable (species).  

```{r}
# plot petal length against flower species  
plot(x = iris$Species,
     y = iris$Petal.Length,
     xlab = "Species",                       # set the x axis label
     ylab = "Petal Length (cm)",             # set the y axis label
     main = "Petal Length for each species") # set the plot title
```  

R has automatically recognised that we are plotting a continuous variable against a categorical one, hence it has generated a boxplot of our data.

All of these plots have been using the built-in R function `plot()` to visualise our data. There are many R packages out there for visualising data. One of the most popular being `ggplot2`. The ggplot2 package comes with extensive documentation but the syntax for plotting can be a bit tricky at first. I won't go through it here, but as an example, here's a piece of R code using the ggplot syntax to make the original scatterplot of the iris data. 

```{r}
# load ggplot package
library(ggplot2) # remember, this can be installed by running "install.packages('ggplot2')"

# plot petal length against flower species  
ggplot() + geom_point(data = iris, 
                      mapping = aes(x = Petal.Width, 
                                    y = Petal.Length,
                                    col = Species),
                      size = 2.5) +
            xlab("Petal Length (cm)") + ylab("Petal Length (cm)") +
            ggtitle("Petal length vs petal width")
```     

There are plenty of R blogs out there that can guide you when using ggplot2. [Here's a link](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/versions/3.3.2) to the documentation. 

## Summary of R content

In summary, these introduction to R tutorials should have equipped you with what you need to start running the `RgeoProfile` package. In an incredibly short space of time we have covered:

* The Rstudio interface and saving a script
* Writing, running and commenting code
* Assigning and naming objects
* Arithmetic and logical operators
* Writing and using functions
* Different classes and data types
* Installing and using R packages
* Navigating directories and reading data
* Using data frames
* Using and plotting data sets 

 This is a lot of material! Like learning any new skill, your ability to code will develop slowly over time and will come with practice. So don't be too disheartened if it was hard to digest all of the content in these tutorials. You will always be able to return to these tutorials for a reminder of anything that's forgotten. I also encourage you to go searching for other R tutorials. The [extra resources](https://michael-stevens-27.github.io/Rgeoprofile/articles/General_R.html) page under the "R basics" tab contains a small collection of other resources to help develop your R skills.
