## Introduction 

In this final R tutorial we will work through the last subjects to get you up to speed before moving on to geographic profiling in R. This tutorial will focus on the following: 

* Installing and using R packages
* Directories and reading data
* Plotting
* Getting help

## Packages

In the previous tutorial we touched on a few of R's built in functions. We even saw an example of writing our own `add` function. You may find yourself in a position where you need a function that R's built-in library cannot provide you with and that may be too complex to write yourself. There are a number of **R packages** that can be downloaded that provide you with extra functions for many different uses. We will see in the next tutorial how to download `RgeoProfile`, a package for spatial analysis. Navigate to the "Packages" tab of the bottom right pane in Rstudio.

\  

Here we can see all of the packages that are already been downloaded. To load a package we use the `library()` function. For example, to load the "raster" package, we would run:

```{r}
# load raster package
library(raster)
```

The raster package also loads another package for spatial analysis; the "sp" package. Notice the empty boxes down the left hand side of the "Packages" tab. Clicking on these boxes is another method for loading packages.

\  

In order to install a package that is not in our system, we use the `install.packages()` function in the following way:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install package
install.packages("INSERT PACKAGE NAME HERE")
```

The `install.packages()` function will download the chosen package from **CRAN**, the online repository for R packages. The full list of R packages can be found [via this link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_date.html).

## Directories and reading data

In addition to many built-in functions, R also comes with a variety of different data sets for a user to play around with when developing their R skills. To see the full list of datasets provided by R and other packages, run the `data()` function with blank parantheses.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# show list of built-in data sets
data()
```

\  

Here we can see a few examples, including the "mtcars" data set, this describes the ouput of road tests carried out on a series of popular motor vehicles. To load the "mtcars" data set, we simply return to the `data()` function:

```{r}
# load mtcars data set
data(mtcars)

# view to first handful of rows of this data set using the head() function 
head(mtcars)
```

R was built for statistical analysis, but a user will need to provide their own data before they can run an analysis.
